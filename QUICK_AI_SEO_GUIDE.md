# ⚡ Quick AI-SEO Guide (2-Minute Read)

## The Problem

When users ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini about your industry:
- ❌ Your company isn't mentioned
- ❌ Competitors get all the visibility
- ❌ You're losing potential customers

## Why It Happens

AI search engines work differently:

1. User asks: "What is the best [your product category]?"
2. AI breaks it into 10-15 sub-questions (fanout queries)
3. AI searches for content answering those questions
4. AI finds competitors' content (because they covered everything)
5. AI cites competitors, not you

**You're invisible because you have content gaps.**

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Identify the Gap (2 minutes)

Ask ChatGPT or Perplexity a query where you should appear:
```
"What is the best project management software for startups?"
```

❌ If your product isn't mentioned → You have a gap

### Step 2: Generate Fanout Queries (1 minute)

1. Open your fanout tool: http://localhost:5173
2. Enter the query
3. Click "Generate"
4. Download "Content Brief"

**You'll get 10-15 queries like:**
- What is project management software?
- Top PM tools comparison
- How much does PM software cost?
- Implementation guide
- Common mistakes
- ROI and metrics
- etc.

### Step 3: Fill the Gaps (Ongoing)

**Option A: One Big Article**
Write one comprehensive guide answering all 10-15 queries.

**Option B: Multiple Articles**  
Create separate articles for each fanout query.

**Result:** Next time AI searches, it finds YOUR content → Cites YOU

## Real Example

### Before Using Fanout Tool

**Your Content:**
- "What is Email Marketing" (blog post)
- "Email Marketing Tips" (blog post)

**User asks AI:** "Best email marketing software for e-commerce"

**AI searches internally:**
1. What is email marketing automation?
2. Top email marketing platforms 2024
3. Mailchimp vs Klaviyo comparison ← You're missing this
4. Email marketing pricing ← You're missing this
5. E-commerce email features ← You're missing this
6. Integration with Shopify ← You're missing this
7. Email marketing ROI ← You're missing this
8. Common email marketing mistakes ← You're missing this

**Result:** 
- AI cites Mailchimp and Klaviyo (they covered everything)
- You're invisible (only answered 2/8 queries)

### After Using Fanout Tool

1. **Generate fanouts** for "Best email marketing software for e-commerce"
2. **Get 12 queries** covering all angles
3. **Write comprehensive guide** answering all 12
4. **Publish** with sections for each query

**Next time user asks AI:**
- AI searches same 12 queries
- Finds YOUR guide answering ALL of them
- Cites YOU alongside (or instead of) Mailchimp/Klaviyo
- You get traffic and credibility
