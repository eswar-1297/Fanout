# 📝 Content Team Guide - Fanout Query Generator

## What is This Tool?

The Fanout Query Generator helps your content team create **comprehensive, well-researched content** by breaking down any topic into multiple research angles and sub-topics.

Think of it like having an AI research assistant that tells you: "Here are ALL the things people want to know about this topic."

## How It Works

When users search on AI-powered search engines (like Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google SGE), the AI doesn't just answer directly. It first breaks the question into multiple sub-queries to gather comprehensive information.

**This tool does the same thing for your content planning!**

### Example:

**Your Input:** "What is artificial intelligence?"

**Tool Generates:**
- ✅ What is artificial intelligence definition and history?
- ✅ How does artificial intelligence work?
- ✅ Types of artificial intelligence (narrow vs general vs super AI)
- ✅ AI vs machine learning vs deep learning differences
- ✅ Real-world applications of AI in 2024
